    <p> We all ate the snaks that we brought but that just filled us up
      and now we are  giong to be on time to our hotel but, know we have 
      another problem we are running out of gas but we have enought to 
      reach nyc but than we will have to pay more money there than where we are 
      and it will be more expensive so should we 
      <a href="getgas.html">stop</a> or
