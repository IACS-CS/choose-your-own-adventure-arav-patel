    <h1> Eat outside </h1>
    <p>So we all ate outside at taco bell. It was so good! But know we 
      have added an extra 2 hours to our 
      of estimate time arrival and know we will be late and we will miss our
       hotel check in time so we have 3 options.
       <ul>
        <li><a href="getnemhotel.html"> get a new hotel </a></li>
        <li><a href="overspeed.html">over speed </a> </li>
        <li><a href="stayatfamilyhouse.html"> stay at realtives house</a> </li>
      </ul>
